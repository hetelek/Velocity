# Analysis Corrections Applied

**Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Analysis**: Second /speckit.analyze run  
**Result**: 4 minor issues identified and corrected

## Issues Corrected

### 1. Typo Fix: "acceBss" → "access" (LOW - Cosmetic)
**Location**: `spec.md` line 266 (SC-006)  
**Issue**: Typographical error in success criterion  
**Fix**: Changed "Users can acceBss logs" to "Users can access logs"  
**Impact**: None (cosmetic only)

### 2. Typo Fix: "gamertagsshould" → "gamertags should" (LOW - Cosmetic)
**Location**: `spec.md` line 197 (Edge Cases)  
**Issue**: Missing space between words  
**Fix**: Changed "invalid gamertagsshould validate" to "invalid gamertags should validate"  
**Impact**: None (cosmetic only)

### 3. Task Clarification: T068 Keyboard Navigation (LOW - Clarity)
**Location**: `tasks.md` Phase N  
**Issue**: Audit task didn't clarify if implementation was needed  
**Fix**: Added note "Qt framework provides baseline; verify custom dialogs follow standards"  
**Impact**: Clarifies that Qt provides baseline keyboard navigation; task is to verify, not implement from scratch

### 4. Task Enhancement: T067 Update Check (LOW - Completeness)
**Location**: `tasks.md` Phase 11  
**Issue**: Review-only task didn't account for missing implementation  
**Fix**: Added "implement basic update check if missing" to task description  
**Impact**: Ensures update check feature (FR-042) is implemented if not already present

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Issues Found**: 4 (all LOW severity)
- **Issues Fixed**: 4 (100%)
- **Files Modified**: 2 (spec.md, tasks.md)
- **Critical/High Issues**: 0
- **Medium Issues**: 0 (T1 terminology issue was false positive - clarification reference is valid)
- **Low Issues**: 4

## Quality Assessment After Corrections

- ✅ **100% FR coverage maintained** (all 44 FRs have tasks)
- ✅ **Constitution compliance maintained** (no violations)
- ✅ **Typos eliminated** (specification is now publication-ready)
- ✅ **Task clarity improved** (audit vs. implementation explicit)
- ✅ **Zero blocking issues** (ready for Phase 1 implementation)

## Next Steps

1. **Commit corrections** to branch `001-baseline-capabilities`
2. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** (Tasks T001-T003: environment setup)
3. **Proceed to Phase 2** (Tasks T004-T012: platform abstraction - BLOCKING)
