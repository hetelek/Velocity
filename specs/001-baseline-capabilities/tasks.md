# Tasks: Velocity Baseline Capabilities

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-baseline-capabilities/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Optional. This baseline focuses on manual smoke tests as per the constitution; add Qt Test/GoogleTest items later if requested.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Ensure environment and presets are ready; no code changes to core.

- [x] T001 Verify CMake preset `windows-mingw-debug` works; ensure `compile_commands.json` exports (no file changes) — ✅ COMPLETE (verified 2025-10-21: preset configures successfully, compile_commands.json generated)
- [x] T002 [P] Validate Qt 6.7.3+ detection (`qmake6 --version`) and Botan availability (no file changes) — ✅ COMPLETE (verified 2025-10-21: Qt 6.8.0 detected, Botan download configured)
- [x] T003 [P] Confirm out/build/<preset>/ is ignored and clean up local artifacts (no file changes) — ✅ COMPLETE (verified 2025-10-21: build directory properly git-ignored)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Platform abstraction (TOP PRIORITY) + UX guardrails needed by all stories.

**⚠️ Platform Abstraction (Constitution III-A - MUST complete first)**:

- [x] T004 Audit `XboxInternals/` public headers for exposed platform-specific types (Windows handles, POSIX fds, etc.); document in `specs/001-baseline-capabilities/platform-audit.md` — ✅ COMPLETE (commits d8271e6, 2cc9003, 8ba64ed)
- [x] T005 [P] Identify file I/O hotspots in `XboxInternals/` calling platform APIs directly; categorize: replaceable with `std::filesystem` vs. requiring PIMPL — ✅ COMPLETE (commits 9a91471, 83ab1e0, 6d6431e)
- [x] T006 [P] Identify threading/sync hotspots in `XboxInternals/` using platform-specific primitives; categorize: replaceable with `std::thread`/`std::mutex` vs. requiring platform code — ✅ COMPLETE (no threading hotspots requiring changes identified)
- [x] T007 [P] Identify crypto/Botan integration points in `XboxInternals/` exposing platform dependencies — ✅ COMPLETE (Botan integration reviewed, no platform leakage found)
- [x] T008 Replace platform-specific file I/O with `std::filesystem` (paths, directory iteration, file metadata) and `std::fstream` where behavior-equivalent in `XboxInternals/` — ✅ COMPLETE (commits 9a91471 SvodMultiFileIO, 83ab1e0 FatxDrive, 6d6431e FatxDriveDetection, efcfb9d Xdbf)
- [x] T009 Replace platform-specific threading with `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, `std::atomic` where behavior-equivalent in `XboxInternals/` — ✅ COMPLETE (no threading primitives requiring migration identified)
- [x] T010 For remaining unavoidable platform code: create abstract interfaces with clear contracts in `XboxInternals/` — ✅ COMPLETE (DeviceIO verified, commit 495d07b)
- [x] T011 Implement PIMPL wrappers for unavoidable platform hotspots; move platform code to `*_win.cpp`, `*_posix.cpp` in `XboxInternals/` — ✅ COMPLETE (DeviceIO existing PIMPL confirmed constitution-compliant, commit a792e92)
- [x] T012 Update `XboxInternals/` public headers to remove platform includes; verify `Velocity/` compiles cleanly and smoke test affected flows — ✅ COMPLETE (TypeDefinitions.h reviewed as only legitimate platform conditional, commits a5f75dc, 9c64033)

**UI Foundation**:

- [ ] T013 Add consistent write operation confirmation guidance strings (backup warnings, validation status, confirmation prompts) in `Velocity/` UI components (centralize copy in helper header)
- [ ] T014 [P] Wire long-op progress dialogs for open/extract/export in `Velocity/` (review `multiprogressdialog.*`)
- [ ] T015 [P] Add validation indicator plumbing (verified|failed|unknown with specific reasons) in `Velocity/`
- [ ] T016 Ensure error messages include actionable next steps (permissions, disk full, unsupported variant) in `Velocity/`
- [ ] T017 [P] Implement Help → View Logs dialog with search/filter in `Velocity/`
- [ ] T018 [P] Add "Save Support Bundle" (zip logs) to View Logs dialog in `Velocity/`

- [ ] T032 [US3] Audit all write/edit entry points (menus, dialogs, context actions) in `Velocity/` to verify backup-or-abort policy
- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] Ensure all edit handlers create backups before writes and abort with clear messaging on backup failure in `Velocity/`
- [ ] T034 [US3] Add validation that backups are created for all write paths; add defensive checks for any latent code that might bypass backup (constitution violation safeguard) in `Velocity/`

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Create Xbox 360 content from scratch (Priority: P2)

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T068 [P] Audit keyboard nav + focus order for all dialogs/wizards (a11y baseline) in `Velocity/` — Qt framework provides baseline; verify custom dialogs follow standards
- [ ] T069 [P] Verify AA contrast in default theme across all dialogs and document findings in `Velocity/`
- [ ] T070 [P] Document sample file sources and checksums for all formats in `specs/001-baseline-capabilities/quickstart.md` — Builds upon T026 smoke test documentation; focuses on sample file acquisition guidance
- [ ] T071 [P] Update `README.md` with complete feature list and expanded audience summary
- [ ] T072 [P] Add/refresh screenshots for all major features and save to `specs/001-baseline-capabilities/`
- [ ] T073 [P] Audit and remove obsolete read-only enforcement code that contradicts US3-US6 editing features; update any stale UI copy/messages in `Velocity/` — **Note: Current FR-006 (crypto validation) is correct and should NOT be removed; this targets old read-only blocks that prevent editing**
- [ ] T074 [P] Update error dialogs to include "View Logs" button and guidance to export Support Bundle when reporting issues (FR-011) in `Velocity/` — **Required to complete FR-011 integration; must be done alongside T017-T018**
- [ ] T075 [P] Implement backup location preference in Preferences dialog with path picker and validation; add "Open Backup Folder" action to Tools menu; persist via QSettings (FR-039) in `Velocity/preferencesdialog.*` — **Note: Consider moving to Phase 2 or earlier since backup location affects US3 write operations (Phase 5)**
- [ ] T076 Verify Botan artifacts present for runtime crypto features in `out/build/<preset>/` (release checklist)
- [ ] T079 [P] [FE-006] Create `.github/workflows/build.yml` workflow for automated Windows builds with MinGW and Qt 6.8.0
- [ ] T080 [P] [FE-006] Configure build workflow to upload artifacts (Velocity.exe, XboxInternals.dll, Botan artifacts) after successful builds
- [ ] T081 [FE-006] Optional: Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated GitHub Releases on version tags; document CI/CD setup in BUILD.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Phases must be executed in order. Within phases, tasks marked [P] can proceed in parallel.
- US1 (P1) is MVP baseline and should be validated first.
- US2/US3 follow as core viewing/editing capabilities.
- US4/US5/US6 (P2) can proceed in parallel as they touch different subsystems (creation wizards, profile tools, device tools).
- US7/US8/US9 (P3/P4) are lower priority extensions and utilities.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T002, T003 can run alongside T001
- In Phase 2: T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel; T008-T009 depend on them; T014, T015, T017, T018 can run in parallel with abstraction work
- In US1: T020, T021, T022 can run in parallel; T023 depends on them; T077-T078 can run in parallel after T023
- In US2: T028, T029, T030 can run in parallel; T031 depends on them
- In US3: T033 can proceed in parallel with T032; T034 follows
- In US4: T036, T037, T038, T039 can run in parallel; T040-T041 follow
- In US5: T043, T044 can run in parallel with T042; T045-T046 follow
- In US6: T048, T049 can run in parallel with T047; T050 follows
- In US7: T052 can run in parallel with T051; T053-T054 follow
- In US8: T056-T062 can all run in parallel; T063 follows
- In US9: T065, T066, T067 can run in parallel with T064
- In Phase N: T068-T076 many can run in parallel as they are independent audits/reviews
