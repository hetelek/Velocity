# Feature Specification: Velocity Baseline Capabilities

**Feature Branch**: `001-baseline-capabilities`  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: Draft - Expanded to include all existing functionality  
**Input**: User description: "Complete specification of Velocity's current functionality and audience. Velocity is a desktop application for browsing, editing, and creating Xbox 360 files and storage, supporting Xbox-specific cryptography, XDBF (GPD), YTGR, STRB (Avatar Assets), FATX, STFS, and Xbox disc formats (SVOD, GDFX). Primary users are game modders, digital archivists, and power users who need to inspect, extract, edit, and create content from storage devices, profiles, achievements, themes, gamer pictures, and content packages with responsive UI, progress feedback, and safety mechanisms (backups, validation). Includes creation wizards, profile management tools, device/FATX utilities, plugin system, and comprehensive editing capabilities."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: Diagnostics and user-accessible logs → A: In-app "View Logs" dialog with search and a "Save Support Bundle" (zip) export.
- Q: Accessibility scope for the baseline → A: Basic keyboard navigation and focus order for core dialogs and lists; readable contrast in default theme.
- Q: Extraction conflict policy → A: On first filename conflict, prompt with Overwrite / Skip / Rename and "Apply to all" checkbox.
- Q: Sample file sourcing for smoke tests → A: Document where users can obtain their own samples (e.g., legally owned device backups) and provide checksum/format references.
- Q: Cryptographic validation detail level → A: Show specific failure reasons in the UI (e.g., "signature mismatch", "missing certificate") alongside the indicator.
- Q: When automatic backup creation fails (disk full, permission denied), what should happen to the pending write operation? → A: Abort write operation immediately; show error; require user to resolve backup issue (disk space, permissions) before retrying.
- Q: Where should automatic backups be stored and how should retention be managed? → A: User-configurable backup location set in Preferences; defaults to Dedicated Backups/ folder in Velocity app data directory.
- Q: What level of isolation/sandboxing should the plugin system provide for security and stability? → A: Plugins run in same process with full memory access; show prominent warning on first plugin load that plugins can crash Velocity and access sensitive data; require explicit user consent.
- Q: What performance targets should apply to write operations (edit, save, create) on typical files? → A: No hard time limits; progress must appear within 0.5 seconds; operations remain cancelable; warn if >30 seconds elapsed.

## Implementation Notes

### Session 2025-10-20 to 2025-10-21 - Package Viewer GUI Modernization

**Code Quality Improvements:**

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse and extract Xbox content (Priority: P1)

As a power user, I can open an Xbox storage source (device image, content package, or disc image) and browse its contents in a safe, read-only mode, so I can quickly locate and extract files without risking accidental changes.

**Why this priority**: Browsing and safe extraction are the core purposes for archivists and modders and are the most common workflows.

**Independent Test**: Using public sample images/packages, open each supported format and extract a chosen file/folder to a local directory; verify no writes occur to the source and the UI remains responsive with progress feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a FATX device image, when I open it, then I see partitions and a file tree and can extract selected items with progress and cancel.
2. Given an STFS package (e.g., save/content), when I open it, then I see metadata and its file tree and can extract files to disk.
3. Given a disc image (SVOD or GDFX), when I open it, then I can browse its structure and extract selected files without modifying the image.

---

### User Story 2 - Inspect profiles and achievements (Priority: P2)

As an archivist, I can open profile/GPD (XDBF) files to review account/profile metadata and achievements, enabling documentation and non-destructive analysis.

**Why this priority**: Profiles and achievements are high-value data for preservation and modding; read-oriented review supports many use cases.

**Independent Test**: Open representative GPD files and confirm key fields and achievements are viewable and can be exported in a common format for analysis.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a GPD file, when I open it, then I can view profile identifiers and a list of achievements with basic details.
2. Given the list of achievements, when I choose export, then both CSV and JSON exports are available with the visible fields, including at minimum: titleId, achievementId, name, description, unlocked (true/false), timestamp (if present), and gamerscore.

---

### User Story 3 - Perform safe edits with explicit confirmation (Priority: P3)

As an experienced user, I can make edits (metadata changes, profile modifications, file operations) with automatic backup protection and explicit confirmation, so that I can modify content without risking data loss. If backup creation fails, the application prevents the write operation to ensure I never lose the original file.

**Why this priority**: Editing capabilities are essential for modders and power users; mandatory backup-or-abort policy protects against data loss while enabling modification workflows.

**Independent Test**: Attempt an edit on a test copy, confirm a backup is created automatically before changes, verify changes are applied with validation, and test that backup failure prevents the write operation entirely.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given an STFS package, when I edit metadata, then the application creates a backup automatically before applying changes; if backup fails, the edit is aborted with clear guidance.
2. Given a GPD file in the profile editor, when I modify achievements or profile data, then changes are validated and backed up before saving; backup failure prevents any write.
3. Given a FATX device image, when I perform file operations, then the application creates backups before write operations; users can restore from backups via Tools menu.

---

### User Story 4 - Create Xbox 360 content from scratch (Priority: P2)

As a modder or content creator, I can create new Xbox 360 packages, profiles, themes, and gamer picture packs using guided wizards, so that I can produce custom content for personal use or distribution.

**Why this priority**: Creation tools enable modding community and custom content generation, core value proposition for power users.

**Independent Test**: Use each creation wizard to generate a valid package/profile/theme/gamer picture pack and verify it opens correctly in Xbox 360 or Velocity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the Package Creator wizard, when I select files and configure metadata, then a valid STFS package is created and can be opened.
2. Given the Profile Creator wizard, when I set gamertag and avatar options, then a valid profile package with GPD files is created.
3. Given the Theme Creator wizard, when I configure colors and upload assets, then a valid theme package is created.
4. Given the Gamer Picture Pack Creator, when I add images, then a valid gamer picture package is created.

---

### User Story 5 - Manage and modify profiles (Priority: P2)

As a user managing Xbox 360 profiles, I can use specialized tools to add games, clean unwanted data, and edit profile details comprehensively, enabling profile maintenance and customization.

**Why this priority**: Profile management is a frequent workflow for modders and archivists; specialized tools streamline complex operations.

**Independent Test**: Open a profile, use Game Adder to add a title, use Profile Cleaner to remove data, verify profile remains valid.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the Game Adder tool, when I search for a title and add it to a profile, then the game appears in the profile with proper metadata and zero achievements.
2. Given the Profile Cleaner wizard, when I select data categories to remove, then the selected data is deleted safely with backup.
3. Given the Profile Editor, when I open a profile package, then I can view and edit comprehensive profile data including achievements, games, avatar, settings, and titles.

---

### User Story 6 - Work with device images and raw FATX volumes (Priority: P2)

As an advanced user working with device images or raw Xbox 360 storage, I can use the Device Viewer to browse partitions and files, and use FATX utilities to generate file paths and perform cluster-level operations.

**Why this priority**: Device-level access is essential for archiving physical hardware and forensic analysis.

**Independent Test**: Open a device image, browse partitions, extract files, use FATX path tool to generate paths.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the Device Viewer, when I open a raw device or image, then I can see all partitions (System, Content, etc.) and browse their FATX file trees.
2. Given the FATX File Path Tool, when I provide file metadata, then I can generate the correct FATX path for locating files on device.
3. Given cluster-level tools, when I inspect or modify clusters, then I can perform low-level FATX operations with warnings.

---

### User Story 7 - Extend functionality with plugins (Priority: P3)

As a developer or advanced user, I can load game-specific or profile-specific modder plugins to extend Velocity's capabilities for specific titles or custom workflows.

**Why this priority**: Plugin system enables community extensions and game-specific tooling without core codebase changes.

**Independent Test**: Install a plugin, verify it appears in the Plugins menu, use it to modify a game save or profile.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a game modder plugin, when I load it, then it appears under Plugins → Game Modders and can operate on compatible save files.
2. Given a profile modder plugin, when I load it, then it appears under Plugins → Profile Modders and can operate on profile packages.
3. Given the plugin system, when a plugin completes, then Velocity returns control and reflects any changes made by the plugin.

---

### User Story 8 - Inspect and work with specialized Xbox formats (Priority: P3)

As a user handling specialized Xbox 360 file formats, I can open and work with YTGR (avatar assets), STRB (avatar assets), SVOD disc images, and view/edit format-specific properties like certificates, security sectors, volume descriptors, licensing data, and transfer flags.

**Why this priority**: Specialized formats and properties are needed for advanced modding, preservation, and debugging.

**Independent Test**: Open each specialized format, view format-specific dialogs, verify data is correctly displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a YTGR file, when I open it, then I can view avatar asset metadata and structure.
2. Given an STRB file, when I open it, then I can view and potentially extract avatar asset data.
3. Given an STFS package, when I view its certificate, then I can see certificate details, issuer, and validity.
4. Given an STFS package, when I view licensing data, then I can see license type, device IDs, and restrictions.
5. Given an SVOD system, when I open it, then I can browse the disc structure and view volume descriptors and file info.

---

### User Story 9 - Discover and organize content with utilities (Priority: P4)

As a user working with Xbox 360 content, I can use utility tools like Title ID Finder to look up game information, address converters for technical operations, and preferences to customize Velocity's behavior.

**Why this priority**: Utilities streamline workflows and improve discoverability; lower priority as they support rather than enable core tasks.

**Independent Test**: Use Title ID Finder to search for a game, adjust preferences, verify settings persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the Title ID Finder, when I search for a game name or title ID, then I can view matching titles with IDs and metadata.
2. Given the Address Converter dialog, when I input addresses or offsets, then I can convert between different Xbox 360 addressing schemes.
3. Given Preferences, when I adjust settings (file paths, UI options), then settings persist across sessions.

---

### Edge Cases

- Corrupted or partially downloaded images/packages should open in a guarded mode with clear warnings; operations that rely on missing data are disabled; editing operations are blocked.
- Very large images/packages should stream or page content to keep the UI responsive; long-running operations expose progress and cancel; creation wizards should validate size limits before processing.
- Missing cryptographic material should not block read-only browsing; validation indicators display "unknown/unverified" with guidance; editing operations should warn about invalidated signatures.
- Unsupported/rare variants of formats should fail gracefully with actionable messages and links to logs or documentation; plugins should handle unknown formats without crashing.
- File system permission issues on extraction/write destinations should be handled with clear prompts to choose a different location or elevate privileges where appropriate.
- Filename conflicts during extraction should prompt the user on first occurrence with Overwrite / Skip / Rename options and an "Apply to all" checkbox for batch behavior.
- Profile editing operations that would create invalid states (e.g., duplicate achievement IDs, invalid title IDs) should be blocked with clear validation messages.
- Plugin load failures should be logged and reported without preventing other plugins or core functionality from loading.
- Plugin execution errors (crashes, exceptions) should be caught where possible; the main application should remain stable and provide error details to the user. Uncaught plugin exceptions may still crash Velocity since plugins run in-process.
- Device write operations should verify FATX integrity before and after writes; failed writes should restore from backup automatically.
- If backup creation fails before a write operation (disk full, permissions), the operation must abort immediately with clear guidance on resolving the backup issue (free disk space, adjust permissions, select different backup location).
- Theme/gamer picture creation with invalid image formats or sizes should reject inputs early with clear guidance on requirements.
- Profile creation with invalid gamertags should validate character limits and allowed characters before allowing submission.
- Update checks should fail gracefully when network is unavailable and not block application startup.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A new user can open each supported source type (FATX, STFS, GPD, SVOD/GDFX, YTGR, STRB) and extract at least one file within 3 minutes without external instructions.
- **SC-002**: For 95% of operations (open, extract, edit, save, create) on representative samples, visible progress appears within 0.5 seconds and remains responsive; users can cancel at any time prior to completion.
- **SC-003**: 100% of edit and creation operations require explicit confirmation and create restorable backups before changes are applied (where applicable). Operations exceeding 30 seconds display status updates or warnings to keep users informed.
- **SC-004**: Error messages enable self-resolution for common failures (missing permissions, destination full, unsupported variant, invalid inputs), reducing follow-up support questions for these cases by 50% compared to baseline.
- **SC-005**: During long operations (open, extract, create, edit), the UI remains interactive (window can be moved, menus open) with no perceived freeze longer than 1 second.
- **SC-006**: Users can access logs within two clicks (Help → View Logs) and export a support bundle in under 10 seconds on representative systems.
- **SC-007**: Keyboard-only navigation completes primary flows (open source, browse tree, start extract, export achievements, create package, edit profile) without mouse; default theme achieves AA contrast for text.
- **SC-008**: Creation wizards (Package, Profile, Theme, Gamer Picture) produce valid outputs that open successfully in Xbox 360 consoles or Velocity itself on first attempt for well-formed inputs.
- **SC-009**: Profile tools (Game Adder, Profile Cleaner) complete operations on typical profiles (100-500 achievements) within 10 seconds with progress feedback.
- **SC-010**: Plugin loading completes within 5 seconds for typical plugin collections (<20 plugins); failed plugins are reported but do not block other plugins or core functionality.
- **SC-011**: Device Viewer opens and displays partition structure for typical device images (<500GB) within 30 seconds with browsable file trees.
- **SC-012**: Backup creation for all write operations completes automatically before modification; users can locate backups via clear naming convention (e.g., filename.bak with timestamp) in the configured backup location (default: Velocity app data `Backups/` folder).

### Assumptions

- Users provide their own device images, packages, and content files; cryptographic materials may be unavailable, but operations remain functional with clear verification status and warnings about invalidated signatures after edits.
- All operations (view, extract, edit, create) write to local disk only; network access is required only for optional features (update checks, Title ID Finder lookups if cloud-based).
- Very large sources (multi-GB device images, large packages) may take extended time for initial open and processing; progress and cancel controls are sufficient to keep the experience acceptable.
- Sample files for smoke testing are user-sourced (legally owned device backups, self-created content). Documentation SHOULD provide guidance on obtaining representative samples and list expected checksums/formats for validation.
- Plugins are third-party or community-developed; Velocity provides stable interfaces but does not guarantee plugin quality or compatibility. Plugins run in-process with full memory access and can crash Velocity or access sensitive data. Users must explicitly consent to these risks before loading plugins.
- Xbox 360 content formats and cryptography are well-documented via reverse engineering; Velocity operates on publicly known specifications and does not circumvent active DRM or encryption when prohibited.
- Users understand editing Xbox 360 content may violate terms of service or result in console bans; Velocity provides tools but users are responsible for usage and consequences.
- Backups are stored locally in a user-configurable location (defaulting to Velocity app data `Backups/` folder); users are responsible for backup management and retention policies (manual cleanup or external backup solutions).

### Technical Debt & Refactoring Notes

- **Platform Abstraction**: XboxInternals currently includes platform-specific API calls that should be abstracted behind interfaces using the PIMPL idiom (per constitution III-A). Baseline work SHOULD identify hotspots (file I/O, threading, crypto) and refactor incrementally to hide platform dependencies from public headers.

## Future Enhancements *(deferred)*

These features are identified but not scheduled for the baseline implementation. They may be added in future feature branches based on user demand and priority.

### FE-001: Package Viewer GUI Modernization

**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 2-4 hours per enhancement  
**Description**: Continue enhancing the Package Viewer with modern file type support and user experience improvements.

**Completed in this session**:

### FE-002: Achievement and Avatar Download System Refactor

**Priority**: High (broken functionality — deferred to future branch, NOT baseline-blocking)  
**Effort**: 12-24 hours  
**Description**: Refactor and fix the existing achievement GPD and avatar award download system to be fully functional and maintainable. **Note**: While important, this is deferred to a dedicated future feature branch focused on network reliability; baseline functionality does not depend on the download system.

**Current Implementation**:
- `GpdDownloader` class downloads game GPD and award GPD files from GitHub repository
- `AvatarAssetDownloader` class downloads avatar award assets (v1/v2 skeleton versions)
- Base URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pandoriaantje/xbox360-gpd-files/main`
- Used in Game Adder dialog and Profile Editor
- Downloads are currently **not fully functional** (reported by user)

**Known Issues**:
- Download reliability problems (needs investigation)
- Error handling may be insufficient
- Network timeouts not properly handled
- GitHub repository availability/structure dependencies
- Spelling: "Unfortunatly" → "Unfortunately" in warning dialog
- Limited feedback during download progress
- No retry mechanism for failed downloads
- Unclear error messages for users

**Proposed Improvements**:
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with detailed user feedback
- **Retry Logic**: Add automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Progress Feedback**: Show download progress (bytes downloaded, speed, ETA)
- **Timeout Configuration**: Make network timeouts configurable
- **Offline Mode**: Cache previously downloaded files, support offline operation
- **Alternative Sources**: Support multiple mirror URLs or fallback repositories
- **Validation**: Verify downloaded GPD files are valid before importing
- **User Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel in-progress downloads
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect GitHub API rate limits, add throttling
- **Modern Async**: Consider using Qt's modern async APIs instead of signals/slots

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Audit current download code paths in `GpdDownloader` and `AvatarAssetDownloader`
2. Identify specific failure modes and root causes
3. Add comprehensive error logging and user-facing error messages
4. Implement download progress UI with cancel button
5. Add retry logic with configurable max attempts
6. Implement download validation (file size, magic numbers, GPD parsing)
7. Add network timeout configuration in preferences
8. Consider caching mechanism for frequently downloaded files
9. Test with various network conditions (slow, intermittent, offline)
10. Update documentation with troubleshooting guide

**Use Cases**:
- Download achievement definitions for games not in local collection
- Obtain avatar awards without manual extraction from packages
- Populate profiles with game data for testing/modding
- Batch download multiple game GPD files in Game Adder
- Recover missing achievement data

**Benefits**:
- Reliable achievement and avatar data acquisition
- Better user experience with clear feedback
- Reduced support burden from download failures
- More robust network error handling
- Professional-grade download management

**Deferred Reason**: Current implementation exists but needs significant reliability improvements. Requires investigation of failure modes, testing infrastructure for network scenarios, and careful refactoring of async code. High priority but needs dedicated focus to implement properly.

### FE-005: Hex Viewer for Binary Files

**Priority**: Low (advanced feature, nice-to-have)  
**Effort**: 2-4 hours  
**Description**: Add a hex viewer dialog for inspecting unknown or binary file types within packages.

**Functionality**:
- Display format: `offset | hex bytes (16 per row) | ASCII preview`
- Read-only viewer using QTextEdit with monospace font (Courier/Consolas)
- Format: `00000000  48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F  72 6C 64 21 0D 0A 00 00  |Hello World!.....|`
- Size limit: 1MB for performance (truncate with warning for larger files)
- Shows printable ASCII (0x20-0x7E), dots for non-printable bytes
- Reuses dialog pattern from XmlDialog/TextDialog (800x600, filename in title)

**Use Cases**:
- View raw bytes of encrypted/compressed files
- Debug corrupted files or unknown formats
- Inspect save game data structures
- Verify file signatures and magic numbers (LIVE, CON, PIRS)
- Fallback viewer for unrecognized file types

**Implementation**:
- Create `hexdialog.h/.cpp/.ui` (similar to textdialog)
- Add helper function to format bytes into hex dump string
- Wire up in packageviewer.cpp for unknown file types or via right-click "View as Hex"
- Add to CMakeLists.txt

**Benefits**:
- Useful for debugging and low-level inspection
- No external dependencies (pure Qt)
- Educational tool for understanding Xbox 360 file formats

**Deferred Reason**: Current file viewers cover the most common file types (.xml, .txt, .cfg, .ini, .json, .log, .toc, images, GPD, STRB). Hex viewing is valuable but serves a smaller audience (advanced users doing format research).

### FE-006: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Priority**: Medium (developer productivity, quality assurance)  
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Description**: Set up automated GitHub Actions workflows to build, test, and release Velocity binaries for every commit and PR.

**Functionality**:
- Automated Windows builds using MinGW 13.1.0+ toolchain
- Automatic Qt 6.8.0 installation via aqtinstall
- Automatic Botan 3.x download and compilation
- Build both Debug and Release configurations using CMake presets
- Run CTest test suites (when available)
- Upload build artifacts (Velocity.exe, XboxInternals.dll, Botan artifacts)
- Optional: Automatic GitHub Releases on version tags

**Use Cases**:
- Verify builds don't break before merging PRs
- Download pre-built binaries for testing without local compilation
- Automated release distribution for users
- Continuous integration for multi-contributor development
- Regression detection via automated test runs

**Implementation**:
1. Create `.github/workflows/build.yml` workflow file
2. Configure Windows runner with MinGW and Qt installation steps
3. Run `cmake --preset windows-mingw-debug` and `cmake --build`
4. Run `ctest --preset windows-mingw-debug` (when tests exist)
5. Upload artifacts using `actions/upload-artifact`
6. Optional: Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` for tagged releases
7. Document CI/CD setup in BUILD.md

**Benefits**:
- Automated quality assurance on every commit
- Pre-built binaries available for testing and distribution
- Faster feedback loop for contributors
- Professional development workflow
- Reduced manual release process

**Technical Requirements**:
- GitHub Actions free tier provides 2,000 minutes/month for private repos (unlimited for public)
- Build time estimated at ~5-10 minutes per run
- Artifact storage: ~50-100MB per build (90-day retention)
- Requires proper CMakePresets.json configuration (already exists)

**Deferred Reason**: Current development workflow works with local builds. CI/CD enhances productivity but is not blocking for single-developer workflow. Should be implemented before accepting external contributions.
