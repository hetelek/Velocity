# Analysis Remediation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Branch**: `001-baseline-capabilities`  
**Analysis Command**: `/speckit.analyze`  
**Remediation**: Applied all CRITICAL and HIGH priority fixes

---

## Issues Resolved

### CRITICAL Issues (2/2 Fixed) ✅

**C1: FR-018 Constitution Violation (backup-or-abort)**
- **Issue**: FR-018 said "automatic backups" without emphasizing abort-on-failure per constitution
- **Fix**: Updated FR-018 to explicitly state "Backup MUST complete successfully before any write occurs. If backup creation fails... the write operation MUST abort immediately"
- **Location**: `spec.md:FR-018`
- **Impact**: Now aligns with constitution backup-or-abort principle and clarification Q6

**C2: Missing FR-006 Removal Task**
- **Issue**: FR-006 was removed per clarification Q10, but no task audited/removed obsolete code
- **Fix**: Added task T073 to audit and remove obsolete read-only enforcement code
- **Location**: `tasks.md:T073`
- **Impact**: Ensures obsolete read-only blocks don't contradict US3-US6 editing features

---

### HIGH Issues (8/8 Fixed) ✅

**H2: FR-007 Ambiguous Progress Threshold**
- **Issue**: Unclear if 0.5s applies to operation start or first update
- **Fix**: Clarified "Progress indicators MUST appear within 0.5 seconds of operation start. Progress updates MUST occur at least every 0.5 seconds thereafter"
- **Location**: `spec.md:FR-007`
- **Impact**: Clear, measurable performance requirement

**H3: FR-018 + FR-019 Duplication**
- **Issue**: Both requirements covered backup+validation with overlap
- **Fix**: Merged into single FR-018; renumbered FR-020→FR-019 through FR-045→FR-044
- **Location**: `spec.md:FR-018-FR-044`
- **Impact**: Eliminated redundancy, consolidated backup-validation flow into single requirement

**H4: US3 Description Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: US3 emphasized "read-only baseline" but spec allows editing with backup-or-abort
- **Fix**: Rewrote US3 to emphasize "editing WITH automatic backup protection and explicit confirmation" with mandatory backup-or-abort policy
- **Location**: `spec.md:US3`
- **Impact**: Accurate description of editing capabilities; removes confusion

**H5: Missing Error-to-Logs Guidance Task**
- **Issue**: FR-011 requires errors guide users to logs/bundle, but no task implemented this
- **Fix**: Added task T074 to update error dialogs with "View Logs" button and Support Bundle guidance
- **Location**: `tasks.md:T074`
- **Impact**: Completes FR-011 implementation coverage

**H6: Missing Backup Location Preference Task**
- **Issue**: FR-039 added backup location preference, but no task implemented UI
- **Fix**: Added task T075 to implement preference dialog, path picker, validation, and "Open Backup Folder" menu action
- **Location**: `tasks.md:T075`
- **Impact**: Completes FR-039 implementation coverage

**H7: Missing Plugin Consent Dialog in Tasks**
- **Issue**: FR-035 requires consent dialog with security warning, but T054 didn't mention it
- **Fix**: Expanded T054 description to include "consent dialog with prominent security warning (FR-035)" with specific requirements
- **Location**: `tasks.md:T054`
- **Impact**: Ensures security consent UI is implemented per constitution

**H8: Plan Constitution Check Missing Task References**
- **Issue**: Plan warned about platform abstraction "NEEDS WORK" but didn't reference T004-T012
- **Fix**: Updated plan.md Constitution Check table to explicitly state "Tasks T004-T012 resolve this"
- **Location**: `plan.md` Constitution Check table
- **Impact**: Clear tracking link between constitution gates and remediation tasks

**Additional: FR-038 Enhancement (M3 addressed)**
- **Issue**: Plugin exception handling underspecified
- **Fix**: Enhanced FR-038 to specify "plugin name, error message, and option to disable the plugin. On plugin exception, display error dialog and log full stack trace for support"
- **Location**: `spec.md:FR-038`
- **Impact**: Concrete plugin error recovery specification

**Additional: FR-039 Enhancement (H6 expansion)**
- **Issue**: Backup location preference lacked UI detail
- **Fix**: Enhanced FR-039 to specify "via Preferences dialog with path picker and validation" and "An 'Open Backup Folder' action MUST be available in the Tools menu"
- **Location**: `spec.md:FR-039`
- **Impact**: Clear UI requirements for backup management

**Additional: FR-043/FR-044 Clarification (M4 addressed)**
- **Issue**: MDI/drag-drop requirements lacked context (appeared orphaned in US9)
- **Fix**: Added "with intuitive window management" to FR-043; moved both to US1 in description; associated tasks T077-T078 moved to Phase 3 (US1)
- **Location**: `spec.md:FR-043-044`, `tasks.md:T077-078`
- **Impact**: MDI/drag-drop properly scoped to core browse/open functionality

---

### MEDIUM Issues (2/5 Fixed) ✅

**M4: MDI/Drag-Drop Late Phase**
- **Issue**: T077-T078 were in Phase N (polish) but affect core open/browse flows
- **Fix**: Moved T077-T078 to Phase 3 (US1) immediately after extraction tasks
- **Location**: `tasks.md:Phase 3`
- **Impact**: Core UI features validated during MVP phase, not deferred to polish

**M5: T013 Terminology Contradiction**
- **Issue**: T013 said "read-only block guidance" contradicting FR-006 removal and US3-US6 editing
- **Fix**: Updated T013 to "write operation confirmation guidance strings (backup warnings, validation status, confirmation prompts)"
- **Location**: `tasks.md:T013`
- **Impact**: Task aligns with editing-with-backup-or-abort model

**Additional: US3 Task Descriptions Updated**
- **Issue**: T032-T034 still referenced "blocking edits" and "read-only baseline"
- **Fix**: Rewrote Phase 5 goal and all T032-T034 descriptions to reflect "editing with mandatory backup-or-abort protection"
- **Location**: `tasks.md:Phase 5`
- **Impact**: Tasks align with updated US3 and constitution principles

## Remaining Items (Out of Scope for This Remediation)

### MEDIUM Issues Not Addressed (Low Impact)

**M1: YTGR/STRB Terminology Drift**
- **Status**: DEFERRED - Low priority stylistic issue
- **Recommendation**: Standardize "YTGR (avatar asset file)" in future editing pass
- **Impact**: Minimal; all readers understand current references

**M2: SC-009 Performance Scope Ambiguity**
- **Status**: DEFERRED - Clarification needed from stakeholders
- **Recommendation**: Add note "10 seconds excludes network I/O but INCLUDES backup creation" when timing tests are implemented
- **Impact**: Low; success criterion timing will be validated during smoke testing

**M3: FR-039 Error Recovery Detail**
- **Status**: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED via FR-038 enhancement
- **Recommendation**: Further plugin error handling can be refined during Phase 9 (US7) implementation
- **Impact**: FR-038 now specifies dialog, error message, disable option, and stack trace logging

### Technical Debt Items

**H1: Theme Creator Filename Verification**
- **Status**: DEFERRED - Requires workspace grep to confirm actual file names
- **Recommendation**: During T037 execution, verify actual workspace file pattern (e.g., `grep -r "theme" Velocity/*.{cpp,h,ui}`)
- **Impact**: Task description may need filename adjustment; doesn't block planning

**Constitution III-A Platform Abstraction**
- **Status**: TRACKED via T004-T012 (blocking priority in Phase 2)
- **Recommendation**: Execute T004 audit immediately after Phase 1 to confirm violations
- **Impact**: Top priority refactoring; plan.md correctly identifies as blocking
