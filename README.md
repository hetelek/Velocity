## Important: Administrator Privileges Required (Windows)

On **Windows**, Velocity requires **Administrator privileges** to access Xbox 360 drives:

- **Right-click** `Velocity.exe` â†’ Select **"Run as administrator"**
- This is necessary for detecting and browsing Xbox 360 hard drives and USB devices
- Without Administrator rights, drives will **not be detected** in the Device Viewer

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#running-velocity) for Linux/macOS requirements and more details.
